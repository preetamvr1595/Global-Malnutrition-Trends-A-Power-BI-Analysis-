Global Malnutrition Trends: A Power BI Analysis (1983-2019)
Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of global malnutrition trends from 1983 to 2019. Using a dynamic Power BI dashboard, it visualizes key malnutrition indicators such as stunting, wasting, overweight, and underweight across various countries and socioeconomic classifications. The goal is to uncover critical patterns, identify high-risk regions, and understand the relationship between economic status and nutritional outcomes.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on malnutrition indicators for children under five across multiple countries, spanning from 1983 to 2019. It includes metrics such as:
 * Survey Sample Size
 * Sum of Underweight, Overweight, Stunting, and Wasting
 * Income Classification
 * Country and Year
Key Insights and Findings
The analysis revealed several critical insights into the state of global malnutrition:
 * The Dual Burden of Malnutrition: The data clearly shows a "dual burden," where undernutrition and overnutrition coexist globally.
   * Overweight Hotspots: Kuwait stands out with a significantly high number of overweight individuals.
   * Persistent Undernutrition: Underweight and stunting remain critical issues, particularly in South Asian countries.
 * Socioeconomic Impact: Income level is a major determinant of nutritional status.
   * Stunting & Income: There is a strong negative correlation between income and stunting; as income classification rises, stunting rates decrease.
   * Overweight in Middle-Income Groups: A high number of overweight cases (over 1,000 in the dataset) are concentrated in the second income classification, highlighting the challenges of nutritional transition in developing economies.
 * Geographic Hotspots:
   * Bangladesh: Emerges as a critical hotspot, accounting for the highest sum of stunting cases and over 50% of the wasting cases in the dataset.
   * Populous Nations: Countries like India and China also feature prominently in the total counts for various malnutrition indicators.
 * Temporal Trends:
   * Over the decades, there has been a general, albeit fluctuating, decline in the rates of stunting and underweight.
   * Wasting saw significant peaks in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Tools Used
 * Microsoft Power BI: For data modeling, analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.
 * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating custom measures and calculations.
 * Microsoft Excel: (Optional: For initial data cleaning and preparation).
How to Interact with the Dashboard
 * Cross-Filtering: Click on any element in a chart (like a country's bar or a section of a pie chart) to filter the entire dashboard page for that selection.
 * Tooltips: Hover over data points on the charts to see more detailed information and specific values.
 * Slicers/Filters: Use the filter pane in Power BI to drill down into specific years, countries, or income classifications.
